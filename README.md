# City Recommender System, 2021

Living through the pandemic, it has become quite evident that we can easily work from home, and no longer need to go into the office. Many companies are now opting for completely remote work, or a hybrid model of some sort. By now, most of us have probably considered the idea of working from a new place, some even long term.

I would like this project to encourage people to take advantage of moving to a new city, and allow them to consider a new place to live feasibly, based on their current living expenditures and environment.

The system will take the user's current city as input, and recommend another city that has similar attributes to their current. The web application through Streamlit hosts the recommender system.

## Data Description
The data used for this project came from numbeo.com, an organization that provides cost of living and quality of life information on different cities across the world. Most of the features are indexed based on NYC standards. NYC being 100. So a value of 120 would be 20% more than NYC cost, and a value of 80 would be 20% less than NYC cost. Currency exchange rates have been accounted for.

Current (2021) information was used for this project, pulled from their Cost of Living, Qulaity of Life and Property Prices data. Please see the 'City_Recommender_System.ipynb' notebook which describes the variables in each dataset.

Please visit their website for more information on their data collection process: https://www.numbeo.com/common/motivation_and_methodology.jsp
